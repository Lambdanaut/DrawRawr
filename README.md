# __Drawrawr__ - A Social Website for Artists

Heya! This is the source code for http://drawrawr.com. Okay, so technically it's not *RIGHT NOW*, but we're working on it! 

Drawrawr.com is a social art website for people that are creative and junk. If you've ever been to deviantart, sheezyart, anipan, or any of those trashheaps, then you pretty much understand exactly what we're developing here. Think all of that, but not quite as bad if we can help it ;)

The code for this fancy website uses the Python web framework [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to respond to requests, [Mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/) to handle database queries, and **optionally** [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to host the user content. I say optionally, because you're welcomed to join in and help out with development, and I wouldn't want to require that you sign up for an entire Amazon S3 account just to slap your keyboard around and make some Drawrawr, now would I? If you don't want to put up with Amazon S3, the system is perfectly capable of storing saved files on your own computer if it is so configured. 

All rights reserved and junk.
