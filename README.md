# __Drawrawr__ - A Social Website for Artists

This is *the* source code that powers Drawrawr.com. The code uses the Python web framework [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to respond to requests, [Mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/) to handle database queries, and **optionally** [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to host the user content. 

Transparency with our users is very important to us at Drawrawr, so having an open source development process was an obvious choice from the get-go. If you're interested in contributing a patch to the code base, you can do so by issuing a pull request through github.
